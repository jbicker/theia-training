# Theia Workshop

[Theia](http://theia-ide.org/) is the new star on the dev tools sky: with Theia, you can write your own IDE-like applications that run as desktop tools as well as in the browser.
Theia is web-native, entirely written in Typescript, and offers a degree of customizability similar to Eclipse RCP.
It is open source and in the process of becoming an Eclipse project, backed by companies like TypeFox, Ericsson, ARM, RedHat, Google, IBM and SAP.

In this workshop, youâ€™ll get acquainted with the base architecture of Theia, you will learn how to compose existing building blocks to author your own specialized IDE, and you will see how to implement your own extensions.

## Exercises

The workshop consists of several exercises.
For each exercise, there are 2 branches in the repository: one with an exercise and another with a solution.

### Getting started

During the workshop, you will use Theia-based Online IDE for GitHub - [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).
To start with the exercises you only need a modern browser. For the best experience, please use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
